# `@[specifies]` and `@[characterization]`: the theorems that say what a definition means

A formalization's definitions are the part a reader has to take on faith: a proof can be checked by
the kernel, but nothing checks that `myDefinition` says what its name suggests. What settles that
question is a handful of theorems — that the definition agrees with the textbook formula on the
base case, that it is monotone, that it reduces to the classical notion in the classical case.

Those theorems already exist in most projects; what is missing is any record of *which* ones they
are. Nothing in the environment distinguishes a characterizing property of a definition from a step
in the proof of something else. `@[specifies]` is that record, written by the author at the point of
the theorem:

```lean
def entropy (p : Distribution α) : ℝ := …

@[specifies entropy "agrees with the textbook formula on finite supports"]
theorem entropy_eq_sum (p : Distribution α) (h : p.support.Finite) :
    entropy p = -∑ x ∈ h.toFinset, p x * Real.log (p x) := …

@[specifies entropy]
theorem entropy_nonneg (p : Distribution α) : 0 ≤ entropy p := …
```

Read back out of the compiled environment (`specEntries`), this gives a tool the two things it
could not otherwise derive: for a definition, the properties its author claims pin it down, and —
just as usefully — which definitions have no such claim at all.

## Importing this module

A file using the module system has to import this one at compile time — `meta import
TrustAnnotations` — because applying an attribute is a compile-time act and a runtime-phase import
does not run the initializer that registers it. Without that, `@[specifies]` is reported as an
unknown attribute. A file not using the module system just writes `import TrustAnnotations`.

## Why an attribute and not a metadata file

Because it cannot silently go stale. The target is an identifier, so it resolves against the
ambient namespaces, a typo is a compile error, and renaming the definition breaks the build at the
annotation. A sidecar file listing declaration names drifts out of date invisibly, which is the
one thing an auditing tool must not do.

## Reading the annotations from another process

Both attributes record their entries in the generic extension of `TrustAnnotations.Core`, as
annotations `specifies` (payload `{"target", "comment"}`) and `characterization` (payload
`{"role", "property", "target", "relation", "relationHead", "comment"}`) on the annotated
declaration. A tool reading a compiled project therefore reads them as it reads every other
attribute of this package, by linking the core once, and `specEntries` and `charEntries` rebuild the
records below from there. The payload keys are the on-disk format; the structures are not.

These attributes were first written as the `Characterization` package (and before that as
`LeanSpec`, in `LeanMachineLearning/exposition`), with extensions of their own; they moved here so
that one extension serves every annotation. The syntax and the checks are unchanged.

## The attribute name

Attribute names are global and unqualified, and Lean rejects a duplicate registration outright: if
a project imports two libraries that both claim a name, neither can be imported. The obvious name
here, `spec`, is already Lean's own — `Std.Tactic.Do` registers `@[spec]` for the specifications
its `mvcgen` verification-condition generator consumes — so this library takes `specifies`, which
also reads better at the use site. The token is declared non-reserved (`&"specifies"`), so a
project can still use `specifies` as an ordinary identifier.

`@[specifies definition "why"]` marks a theorem as part of the specification of `definition`: one of
the properties its author offers as evidence that the definition is the intended one.

Both arguments are optional:

* `@[specifies]` infers the target from the theorem's own name, taking the innermost enclosing
  namespace that is a definition — so `@[specifies] theorem entropy_nonneg` in `namespace entropy`,
  or `@[specifies] theorem entropy.nonneg`, both mean `@[specifies entropy]`.
* the comment is free text, shown next to the theorem wherever the specification is presented. It
  should say what the property *buys* the reader, which the statement alone does not.

Apply it more than once for a theorem that specifies more than one definition
(`@[specifies foo, specifies bar]`).

-- the catch-all `ident`-shaped attribute parser, which also matches it. Without the priority both
-- parsers match to the same position and the category parser emits a `choice` node, which
-- `elabAttr` reports as the (nonexistent) attribute `choice`. The `add` handler below still
-- accepts an `Attr.simple` node, so the bare form keeps working whichever parser wins.

/-- The declaration an entry about the pair `(a, b)` is anchored to — a local one.

Both attributes here relate two declarations, and neither requires them to be declared in the same
module: `attribute [specifies myDefinition] someImportedTheorem` and
`attribute [characterization property myDefinition] SomeImportedPredicate` are the shapes that let
one predicate characterize definitions in several modules without being copied into each. An
attribute writes its entry into the module being *elaborated*, so either of those records the claim
in a module that a reader of the local side reaches.

`none` when both are imported, which is the one configuration to reject: the entry would sit in a
module that neither `a` nor `b` points back to, so a consumer that reaches either of them through
its own imports would never see it.

The result also feeds `asyncDecl`, which has to name a declaration of the current async context

## `@[characterization]` — the theorems that pin a definition down

`@[specifies]` records a claim, and nothing checks it beyond the target resolving. A
*characterization* is the stronger thing, and it is checkable. It comes in three parts:

* a **property** — a predicate `P` with an argument of the definition's type;
* an **existence** theorem — that the definition satisfies `P`;
* a **uniqueness** theorem — that anything satisfying `P` is related to anything else satisfying
  `P` by some relation `R`.

Together those say: the definition is *the* object with property `P`, up to `R`.

```lean
@[characterization property entropy "the Shannon axioms"]
def IsEntropy (p : Distribution α) (h : ℝ) : Prop := …

@[characterization existence]
theorem isEntropy_entropy (p : Distribution α) : IsEntropy p (entropy p) := …

@[characterization uniqueness]
theorem IsEntropy.unique (h₁ : IsEntropy p x) (h₂ : IsEntropy p y) : x = y := …
```

The two theorems name the *predicate*, not the definition, and by default read it off their own
statements. The predicate is the hub because a definition can have more than one characterization
— entropy by the Shannon axioms and entropy by a variational formula — and hanging every part off
the definition would let a tool assemble the pieces of one into the other.

`R` is a relation rather than equality outright because plenty of objects are only determined up
to a.e. equality, or up to isomorphism.

### What is checked, and what is not

The shapes are checked by `isDefEq`, not by matching syntax: the existence theorem's statement has
to *be* `P … (definition …)`, and the uniqueness theorem's has to relate two objects that its own
hypotheses say satisfy `P`. A tool reading a complete bundle back out can therefore report
"characterized" as a checked fact rather than as an author's assertion, which is the whole
difference from `@[specifies]`.

What is *not* checked is that the characterization says anything. `P x := (x = definition)` is a
well-formed characterization that conveys nothing, and so is a `P` that is subtly the wrong
property. The checks buy well-formedness; the reader still has to read `P` and `R`, which is why
any presentation of a characterization has to show both in full, and why a predicate mentioning
the definition it characterizes draws a warning (`characterization.checkNotCircular`).

Two further gaps, both deliberate:

* nothing requires `P` to be `R`-invariant, so a bundle gives `P x → R x definition` and not the
  converse. The first is what a reader needs; the second is extra work for no gain here.
* uniqueness is propositional. "Unique up to *unique* isomorphism" is a term-level statement, and
  a characterization recorded here with `R x y := Nonempty (x ≃ y)` loses the canonicity. For
  universal properties, Mathlib's bundled `IsColimit`-style formulation is the right tool and this
  is a weaker shadow of it.

### Feeding `specEntries`

Both theorems of a characterization are also, trivially, part of the specification of the
definition, so each writes a `SpecEntry` as well. A consumer that only knows about `@[specifies]`
— "which definitions has nobody said anything about" — keeps working without learning about the
second extension.

### One attribute name, and no attribute on the relation

Attribute names are global and unqualified, and a collision between two libraries makes them
mutually un-importable (see the note on the `specifies` name above). The three roles therefore
share one registered name, distinguished by a mandatory keyword.

The relation gets no attribute at all: it is read off the uniqueness theorem's conclusion. That is
the only thing that could work — a relation like `Setoid.r s` is a partial application with no
declaration to annotate in the first place, and requiring one on `Eq` and `Filter.EventuallyEq`
would make every project re-annotate core and Mathlib before it could state a uniqueness theorem.

### Where the annotation lives

A predicate and the definition it characterizes need not be declared in the same module, and the
case that needs them not to be is a *shared* predicate — `IsCondExp`, say — registered against
each of several definitions from those definitions' own modules:

```lean
attribute [characterization property myDefinition] SomeImportedPredicate
```

An attribute writes its entry into the module being elaborated, so this records the claim where a
reader of `myDefinition` finds it. Without it a shared predicate would have to be copied, once per
definition, into every module that wanted to use it.

What is rejected is only the case where the two declarations an entry relates are *both* imported.
The entry would then sit in a module neither of them points back to, and a consumer that reached
either through its own imports would never see it. Same rule for `@[specifies]`, whose entries
relate a theorem and a definition.

### Storage

docstring describes: the payload keys are the format, and `CharEntry` is rebuilt from them.

/-- One `@[characterization …]` annotation: the declaration it was written on, which part of a
characterization that declaration is, and the predicate/definition pair the part belongs to.

parts of one characterization can be grouped without re-deriving anything — a predicate may
characterize more than one definition, and a theorem belongs to exactly one of those bundles.

/-! ### Reading the shapes

Everything below decides, from elaborated types, whether a declaration really has the shape its
annotation claims. Three rules hold throughout:

* comparison is `isDefEq`, not syntactic matching, so a theorem stated in unfolded form still
  counts. The price is that the predicate has to be a `def`, `structure` or `class` the elaborator
  can see through, not something `opaque`.
* metavariables are created *inside* whatever telescope they will be unified against. A
  metavariable cannot be assigned a free variable introduced after it was created, so opening the
  predicate before entering the theorem's binders would make every check fail.
* a trial that may fail runs under `withoutModifyingState`, since a failed `isDefEq` can leave
  partial assignments behind that would poison the next trial.
-/

/-- `pred` applied to fresh metavariables, paired with the metavariable in its last argument
position — the *characterized slot*, the one an object of the definition's type goes into.

`none` when `pred` is not a predicate at all: it has to take at least one argument and land in
`Prop`. The last argument is the slot by convention; a predicate with several arguments of the
definition's type characterizes the last of them. -/
private def openPredicate (pred : Name) : MetaM (Option (Expr × Expr)) := do
  let P ← Meta.mkConstWithFreshMVarLevels pred
  let (args, _, body) ← Meta.forallMetaTelescope (← Meta.inferType P)
  if args.isEmpty then return none
  unless (← instantiateMVars body).isProp do return none
  return some (mkAppN P args, args.back!)

/-- `target` applied to fresh metavariables, at every arity from fully applied down to bare.

A characterization can be of the definition applied to its arguments (`IsCondExp μ f (μ[f|m])`,
the usual case) or of the definition itself as a function, and nothing in the annotation says
which, so both are tried — fully applied first, since that is what authors mean far more often. -/
private def openTargetAtEachArity (target : Name) : MetaM (Array Expr) := do
  let d ← Meta.mkConstWithFreshMVarLevels target
  let (args, _, _) ← Meta.forallMetaTelescope (← Meta.inferType d)
  return (Array.range (args.size + 1)).reverse.map fun k => mkAppN d (args.extract 0 k)

/-- Whether `pred` is a predicate on the type of `target`: its characterized slot accepts `target`
applied to some prefix of `target`'s own arguments. -/
private def isPredicateOn (pred target : Name) : MetaM Bool := do
  let some (_, slot) ← openPredicate pred | return false
  let slotType ← Meta.inferType slot
  for t in ← openTargetAtEachArity target do
    let tType ← Meta.inferType t
    if ← withoutModifyingState (Meta.isDefEq slotType tType) then return true
  return false

/-- Whether `thmType` states that `target` satisfies `pred` — that is, whether it is, under its
binders, `pred` applied to arguments whose last is `target` applied to some prefix of its own.

Forcing the slot to be `target` *before* unifying the whole statement is what makes a single
error message possible: without it a statement of the right shape about the wrong object would
leave the slot holding something else, or nothing at all.

The one false negative worth knowing about: the witness has to be *built from* the definition,
syntactically. `IsDouble 2 4` says that `double 2` satisfies `IsDouble 2`, and says it
definitionally, but unification cannot run `double` backwards to discover that, so it is rejected.
Writing the witness as `double 2` is both accepted and clearer. -/

/-- Whether `thmType` states that `pred` determines its subject up to a relation, and if so that
relation: the conclusion as written, and its head constant.

Two shapes are accepted, both after telescoping the binders:

* `… → pred … x → … → pred … y → R x y`, two hypotheses in `pred`, related to each other;
* `… → pred … x → … → R x (target …)`, one hypothesis, related to the definition itself. That is
  the form Mathlib usually writes (`condExp_unique`) and it is just as good: with the existence
  theorem in hand, `P x → R x definition` is exactly the conclusion a reader wants, and no
  symmetry of `R` is needed to get there.

The relation has to be *applied* — the conclusion's last two arguments are the related pair. One
written inline, as `Nonempty (x ≃ y)` is, has to be given a name and stated as `IsoRel x y`, which
a presentation wants anyway for the same reason it wants a named predicate: something to show the
reader and link to. -/

/--
`@[characterization property definition "why"]`, `@[characterization existence]` and
`@[characterization uniqueness]` mark the three parts of a claim that a definition is *the* object
with a given property: the predicate, the theorem that the definition satisfies it, and the
theorem that nothing else does — up to a relation read off that theorem's own conclusion.

```lean
@[characterization property entropy "the Shannon axioms"]
def IsEntropy (p : Distribution α) (h : ℝ) : Prop := …

@[characterization existence]
theorem isEntropy_entropy (p : Distribution α) : IsEntropy p (entropy p) := …

@[characterization uniqueness]
theorem IsEntropy.unique (h₁ : IsEntropy p x) (h₂ : IsEntropy p y) : x = y := …
```

The role keyword is required. The predicate on the two theorems is optional — by default it is
read off the statement — and can be given when the guess is wrong or ambiguous, as
`@[characterization uniqueness IsEntropy]`. A comment may follow in either position; on the
property it is the place to say what the characterization is *called*.

Unlike `@[specifies]`, the shapes are checked: a theorem whose statement is not what its role
claims is a build error, not a wrong entry in a published specification.
