# Cross-module characterization

`TrustAnnotations/Test/Characterization.lean` exercises the attribute within one module. This file
exercises the thing a single module cannot show: that a predicate and the definition it
characterizes may live in different modules, so that *one* shared predicate can characterize
definitions across a library instead of being copied into each of them.

Two directions, both real:

* a **local predicate** for an **imported definition** — the annotation is written where the
  predicate is;
* an **imported predicate** for a **local definition** — written with a standalone `attribute`
  command, since the predicate is not being declared here. This is the direction that matters: it
  is what lets `IsCondExp`-style predicates be shared.

The rejection is the case neither of those covers, where both sides are imported and the entry
would land in a module that nothing reaches it from.

/-! ## An imported predicate characterizing a local definition

`IsDouble` is declared in `TrustAnnotations.Test.Characterization`, where it already characterizes
`double`. Here it
characterizes a second definition, registered against it from *this* module — which is where a
reader of that definition would look, and which is the whole point: one predicate, several
definitions, no copy of the predicate per module.

`eightyEight` is a numeral rather than anything built from `double`, so the two theorems below
belong unambiguously to its bundle. Written as `double 44` it would be *definitionally* an
application of the imported definition, and `statesExistence` would file the existence theorem
under `double` — correctly, since the statement really would be one about `double 44`. -/

/-- Eighty-eight. -/
def eightyEight : Nat := 88

characterizes `double`"] IsDouble

theorem isDouble_eightyEight : IsDouble 44 eightyEight := rfl

@[characterization uniqueness]
theorem IsDouble.eq_eightyEight {m : Nat} (h : IsDouble 44 m) : m = eightyEight := h

/-! ## A local predicate characterizing an imported definition

The mirror image, and the direction that already worked: here the annotation is written where the
predicate is, and the definition is the imported one. -/

/-- `m` is `n` doubled, said through addition rather than through `n + n`. -/

theorem IsTwice.unique {n a b : Nat} (h₁ : IsTwice n a) (h₂ : IsTwice n b) : a = b :=
  h₁.trans h₂.symm

/-! ## Reading the annotations back

Both bundles have to come back complete, and `IsDouble` has to end up with *two* targets — the
imported `double` from the core module and the local `eightyEight` — since that is the whole
claim: one predicate, several definitions, no copying. -/

/-- The characterizations this module contributed: one side of each is declared here, and the
other is imported. Restricted to those, so that the bundles the core test module records — and the
partial entries its own rejection tests leave behind — do not appear. -/

/-! ## The rejection

Neither declaration is local, so the entry would be recorded in a module that a consumer reaching
`IsTriple` or `triple` through its own imports would never load. -/

/--
error: cannot record a characterization of `TrustAnnotations.Test.Characterization.triple` by `TrustAnnotations.Test.Characterization.IsEven`: both are declared in imported modules, so the entry would sit in a module neither of them points back to and a consumer reaching either through its own imports would not see it. Write the annotation in the module that declares one of them.
